My solutions for (some) [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) tasks

## Goals

I have the following goals, in order of priority.

 1. Write idiomatic code showcasing appropriate language features.
 1. Solve every puzzle in a single file using only standard libraries.
 1. implement asymptotically optimal algorithms regarding both time and space requirements. In particular, do not unnecessarily hold onto the puzzle input in memory.
