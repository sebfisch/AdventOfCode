# Advent of Code

My solutions for (some) [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) tasks

## Goals

I have the following goals, in order of priority.

 1. Write idiomatic code showcasing appropriate language features.
 1. Solve every puzzle in a single file using only standard libraries.
 1. Implement asymptotically optimal algorithms regarding both time and space requirements. In particular, do not unnecessarily hold onto the puzzle input in memory.

My [solutions for 2022](https://github.com/sebfisch/AdventOfCode/tree/latest/year2022) 
use [Java 19](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/19/).
