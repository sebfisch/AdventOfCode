# Java solutions for 2022

 1. Sums and maximums. Reads input lines using a [Scanner](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Scanner.html) and closes it with a [try-with-resources](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html) statement. Implements an [online selection algorithm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_algorithm#Online_selection_algorithm).
 1. Rock, paper, scissors. Uses the [Stream](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/package-summary.html) API to read input lines and defines [enum](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html) and [record](https://openjdk.org/jeps/395) types to represent aspects of the game.
 1. Set intersections. Uses operations on sets from the [collections framework](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/index.html).
 1. More set operations.
 1. Stack operations. Uses the [Dequeue](https://download.java.net/java/early_access/panama/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Deque.html) interface to build and manipulate stacks.
