 1. [Rock Paper Scissors](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2): Reads input lines using the [Stream](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/package-summary.html) API and represent aspects of a game with [enum] and [record] types.
 1. [Rucksack Reorganization](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3): Implements set intersection with the [collections framework].
 1. [Camp Cleanup](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4): Implements set intersection and inclusion with the [collections framework].
 1. [Supply Stacks](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5): Builds and manipulates stacks with the [Deque](https://download.java.net/java/early_access/panama/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Deque.html) interface and defines a hand-written parser for an interesting input format.
 1. [Tuning Trouble](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6): Implements a [circular buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) and checks its contents for duplicates with the [collections framework].
 1. [No Space Left On Device](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/7): Accumulates file sizes using [`merge` on maps](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#merge(K,V,java.util.function.BiFunction)). 
 1. [Treetop Tree House](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/8): Models directions and positions using [enum] and [record] types, constructs streams using a [Stream.Builder](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.Builder.html), and searches in a loop with a [`break` statement](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/branch.html).
 1. [Rope Bridge](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9): Models a Snake-like simulation using [enum] and [record] types and implements a clever way to compute movements.
 1. [Cathode-Ray Tube](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10): Models machine code as [algebraic datatypes](https://sebfisch.github.io/java-data/) implemented using [record] types and [sealed classes](https://openjdk.org/jeps/409) with [default methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html), processes instructions using [pattern matching](https://openjdk.org/jeps/427) with [record patterns](https://openjdk.org/jeps/405) in [switch expressions](https://openjdk.org/jeps/361), and represents a terminal using a [StringBuilder](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/StringBuilder.html).
 1. [Monkey in the Middle](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/11): Another example of algebraic datatypes and pattern matching simulating a game involving [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic).
 1. [Hill Climbing Algorithm](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/12): Implements a [path finding](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/) algorithm with a [Queue](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Queue.html).
